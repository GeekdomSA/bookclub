# Geekdom Bookclub

The Geekdom book club is a weekly meeting to discuss articles and publications relevant to the craft and practice of programming.  

## Time and Location

Thursdays, 6:00-7:00pm at [Geekdom](http://geekdom.com/location/) on the 11th floor in the Berners-Lee conference room.  

## Format

The meetings alternate between book discussion and article/video discussion.  This way participants can choose which nights to attend, and drop in and out as needed.

The first book discussion starts January 17, 2013, with the second installment January 31, and continuing on.  The first article discussion was January 10, followed by January 24, and continuing on.

When in doubt, just check the calendar.

## Calendar 

The repository directory structure also serves as a calendar for upcoming events and reading assignments.
