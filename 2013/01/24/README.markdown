For this week, we will be looking at two videos. Couple things to note, both are
meant for a Ruby audience. `Boundaries` talks about a lot of Ruby, however the
principles remain constant for other languages too. Gary, works in many
different languages. Ruby is simply the easiest way for him to explain some
pseudo code.

* [Architecture The Lost Years](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years)

Take notes on these two videos. I will have a list of questions to cover. So be
prepared!
